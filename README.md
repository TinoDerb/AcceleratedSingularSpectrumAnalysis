# AcceleratedSingularSpectrumAnalysis
An accelerated python function to execute the Singular SpectrumAnalysis algorithm

SSA is a decomposition method that was developed based on the principle of spectral decomposition.

The usage of the classical implementation of SSA was limited to small datasets due to the amount of memory and time the processing takes.

By using the accelerated function in the SSA.py file, it is possible to apply SSA on a large dataset within a reasonable amount of time.

To test the benchmarking, save both files into a folder and run the benchmarking.py file, one with calling the accelerated method and another time with the classical one. Copy the printed times to excel or other software to plot.
